          <h3>A little bit about myself:</h3>
          <br>
          <br> When I finished high school I decided to move to London. I lived there for four years. When I came home I met
          Lilla who became my wife later on. &#9786 I started to work at a cinema as an IT Manager & Chief Projectionist.
          My main task was to maintain the whole cinema computer and projection system, network and solve any upcoming problem.
          I loved that job because it was changing and exciting. When the cinema was closed I decided to become a programmer
          and joined to Green Fox. I think I did it right because I love programming better than anything else. I love learning
          new things and being creative.

        <p>
          In my first two months at Green Fox Academy, I learnt TypeScript, HTML, CSS and a little part of MySQL. I used Visual Studio
          Code as my IDE, Github for version control and Postman to test endpoints during my works.
          <br>
          <br> For the next two months, I chose a project where I learnt Angular 5.
